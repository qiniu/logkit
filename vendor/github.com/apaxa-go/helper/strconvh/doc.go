// Package strconvh provides functions for conversion between basic types and its string representations.
//
// String representation for numeric use 10-base.
// Most of functions have suffix in form of [u]int[8,16,32,64] or float{32,64}. This suffix defines inputs and outputs types for number parameters.
// So it helps avoid a lot of conversions in code.
